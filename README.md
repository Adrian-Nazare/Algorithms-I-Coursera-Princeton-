# Algorithms-I-Coursera-Princeton-
Data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations.

This repository consists of the java files that I worked on, alongside the zipped project folders that contain the dependencies and libraries provided by the course.

My own work:

8puzzle: Board.java, Solver.java
collinear: BruteCollinearPoints.java, FastCollinearPoints.java, Point.java (except DO NOT MODIFY parts)
kdtree: KdTree.java, PointSET.java
percolation: Percolation.java, PercolationStats.java
queues: Deque.java, Permutation.java, RandomizedQueue.java
